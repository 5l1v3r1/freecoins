This is the code for the site [Freecoins](http://freecoins.herokuapp.com), a
simple bitcoin faucet that pays out 0.00005BTC.

If you want to use this as your own faucet, check out `config.example.json` for
some values you'll need to change. Be sure to change things like the footer file
(`views/_footer.haml`) and the ad files, either deleting them (and the
references to them) or changing them to reflect your own ads.

Attribution to this source would be greatly appreciated if you use this as your
own faucet.
