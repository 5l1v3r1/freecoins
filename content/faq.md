Q: How much does this pay?

A: I've decided on BTC0.00005. This is subject to change.

Q: How can I donate to the faucet?

A:  You can donate to the faucet's bitcoin address:
`1M4YQYJ5ssXdSf3wjyNAnP3qZeCBfq6qvc`

Q: Hey! I never got my payment!

A: This could be for one of two reasons:

1. Just wait a while! Payouts are sent every day, if it's been
more than a day, it might be...

2. We're out of money! The faucet might have run out of money.
In which case I will personally try to refill it, if that's not
possible, I apologize. You'll have to wait a week to try again.
You can check the main page and there is a ticker that shows the
current amount of money in the faucet.

Q: Why are you doing this? This seems like a scam.

A: I was frustrated at the lack of (working) Bitcoin faucet sites, so I decided
to make one. Aside from that, there is no way this is a scam. All that you're
giving to the site is your Bitcoin address, nothing else. That Bitcoin address
can *only* be used to give you Bitcoins. There is no way for this site -- or any
other -- to use it to get access to your Bitcoin wallet.
