{"name":"Legendary Faucet","tagline":"The source code for the Legendary Faucet Bitcoin Faucet","body":"ANNOUNCEMENT\r\n============\r\n\r\nUnfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.\r\n\r\nI will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.\r\n\r\nIt is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.\r\n\r\nBTC: [1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx](bitcoin:1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx) | TRC: [1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG](terracoin:1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG) | LTC: [LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5](litecoin:LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5)\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll also take [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour Own Bitcoin Faucet\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThis is the code for the site [Legendary Faucet](http://legendaryfaucet.herokuapp.com), a\r\nsimple bitcoin faucet that pays out 0.00005BTC or more if I'm in a good mood.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this as your own faucet, check out `config.example.json` for\r\nsome values you'll need to change. Be sure to change things like the footer file\r\n(`views/_footer.haml`) and the ad files, either deleting them (and the\r\nreferences to them) or changing them to reflect your own ads.\r\n\r\nAttribution to this source would be greatly appreciated if you use this as your own faucet. It's a fork of the code from [mdszy](https://github.com/mdszy/freecoins) so all the real credit should go to them.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHow To Setup for Heroku\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nFirst sign up for [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).\r\nDownload and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)\r\nLaunch Heroku toolbelt either in the directory you have your code in, or navigate to it.\r\nNow let's run the commands:\r\n\r\n`heroku login`\r\nYou will be asked for your email. Enter this.\r\nYou will then be asked for your password. Enter this.\r\n\r\nExcellent. Now let's play a game of git.\r\n\r\n`git init`\r\n`git add .`\r\n`git commit -m \"foo\"`\r\n\r\nNow create your app\r\n`heroku create`\r\n\r\nLet's push!\r\n`git push heroku master`\r\n\r\nAssuming everything went fine, now you need your database\r\n\r\n`heroku addons:add cleardb:ignite`\r\n\r\nIf you get a message about verifying your account go to [the verify page](http://www.heroku.com/verify) and enter credit card details. So long as you don't use paid services you will **NOT** be charged.\r\n\r\nNow get your database location\r\n`heroku config:get CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL`\r\nYou will see a bit long string that starts mysql: copy this\r\n\r\n`heroku config:add DATABASE_URL=''`\r\nObviously set the contents of the string to what you got from above. **ALL OF IT!**\r\n\r\nIf you want automatic payouts, set up a cron job somewhere that runs\r\n`curl -F secret=yoursecret http://yourapp.herokuapp.com/payout`\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nDonations\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe faucet is purely non-profit for me, it's about giving back to the community. So I won't accept personal donations for this project. However please feel free to send to [1GNCie7qmDKvPHhHmVmqpYHkY689Xx3wkU](bitcoin:1GNCie7qmDKvPHhHmVmqpYHkY689Xx3wkU) and they will be added to The Legendary Faucet!\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/PartTimeLegend/freecoins.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/PartTimeLegend/freecoins) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PartTimeLegend/freecoins.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PartTimeLegend/freecoins) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/PartTimeLegend/freecoins.png)](https://gemnasium.com/PartTimeLegend/freecoins)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
